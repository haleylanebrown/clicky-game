# Clicky Game

## Overview

In this project, I created a simple memory game with React. The goal here was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions

1. The application renders a dozen different images to the screen. 

2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The task for the user is to click on each image once and only once. 

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their score is incremented.

4. If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked in the current round, their score is reset to 0.

5. The application keeps track of the user's Top Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Top Score.
